main.py inference test_batch_size set to 1 originially 20
in the final training code, make sure that retrieval scores -1 are included unlike in the main.py test function. this is just for debugging
will need to make some changes in the train function in main.py too just like in test func
in inference function try ceil and then edit get_batches for cases where data size less than batch size
normalize our doc scores?
does it compute one kg for each batch?
scoring function nn.liner? try cosine similarity?
