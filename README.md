# GraftNet

This is the implementation of GraftNet described in EMNLP 2018 paper "Open Domain Question Answering Using Early Fusion of Knowledge Bases and Text".

### Demo
This repo contains pretrained models with the full text corpus and knowledge base, and generated datasets with incomplete knowledge base (10%, 30%, 50%). The default folder structure is shown as followed:

```
GraftNet
├── *.py
├── config
├── datasets
    ├── webqsp
    └── wikimovie
└── model
    ├── webqsp
    └── wikimovie

```

 - ./config: configuration files for Wikimovies and WebQuestionsSP
 - ./model: pretrained models on full text corpus and knowledge base 
 - ./datasets: retrieved text from full text corpus and sampled knowledge base 


 
To reproduce the result, (1) download data ([WikiMovies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EI8iaHZGuhNGriO94Y-3IxkbSeNUHOxy/view?usp=sharing) [WebQuestionsSP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bgTKxnpDeZnt6sILrgLmu9yiZzdfwDbQ/view?usp=sharing)) and pre-trained model ([WikiMovies](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eHjDJjXRmuWp04CIKJWF7Giivsiz1H9I/view?usp=sharing) [WebQuestionsSP](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1epH4MjM7R2yVzNiXbBeyyEolM9nD8mxT/view?usp=sharing)), and save them under ./model and ./datasets folders respectively, and (2) change the following values in the *.yml file:

 - data_folder: Folder in ./datasets you would like to run
 - to_save_model: True if you would like to save the best model
 - save_model_file: Path to save model
 - pred_file: Path to generate and save predictions
 - load_model_file: Path to load pretrained model. At training time, it will initialize your model with the model pointed by this value. Set it to "null" if you would like to train from scratch.
 - fact_dropout: [0, 1) for training. We won't use it at test time.
 - use_kb: True if use kb
 - use_doc: True if use doc

Then run the following commands:

Train:
```
python main.py --train config/wikimovie.yml
python main.py --train config/webqsp.yml
```
Test:
```
python main.py --test config/wikimovie.yml
python main.py --test config/webqsp.yml
```
Evaluate:
```
python script.py wikimovie KB_PRED DOC_PRED HYBRID_PRED
python script.py webqsp KB_PRED DOC_PRED HYBRID_PRED
```
where *_PRED are the "pred_file" in the .yml file under different settings (with different combinations of "use_doc" and "use_kb").
